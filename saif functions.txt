SAIF AUTOMATIONS – Functional Requirements Specification (FRS)
________________________________________
1. Objective
To define detailed departmental-level functional requirements for the integrated ERP solution of Saif Automations Services LLP, ensuring unified processes across Accounts, Purchase, Stores, Production, R&D, HR, Sales, and After-Sales Service.
The ERP must enable traceability through Unique Identification Numbers (UIDs), document and warranty management, and configurable approval workflows.
________________________________________
2. Core System Foundation
Every part, subassembly, and finished product carries a UID generated at the Goods Receipt stage.
UIDs are tracked through the complete lifecycle:
Procurement → Inventory → Production → Assembly → Sales → After-Sales Service.
Each UID links to vendor, manufacturing stage, and final customer.
