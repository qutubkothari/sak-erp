## 🚨 Mandatory Pre-Delivery Testing Protocol

Before handing over the ERP system to any client, conduct a full, systematic test of every module and workflow. This is a mission-critical application; incomplete or superficial testing can result in severe business impact. The following protocol is mandatory:

1. **Test All Modules End-to-End:**
   - Purchase, Inventory, Production, Quality, Sales, Dispatch, Warranty, Service, Demo Management, HR/Payroll, Document Control, UID Traceability, and any integrations (e.g., Tally).
   - Use the detailed steps in CLIENT_TESTING_GUIDE.md for each module.

2. **Data Integrity & Security:**
   - Validate all data flows, calculations, and access controls.
   - Test for data privacy, especially in HR/Payroll and financial modules.

3. **Role-Based Access & Permissions:**
   - Verify that users only see and act on data relevant to their roles.

4. **Error Handling & Edge Cases:**
   - Simulate failures, invalid inputs, and boundary conditions for every workflow.

5. **Performance & Scalability:**
   - Test with realistic data volumes and concurrent users.

6. **Audit & Compliance:**
   - Ensure all actions are logged and compliance reports are accurate.

7. **Final Review:**
   - Document all test results, issues found, and resolutions.
   - Do not deliver to client until all critical issues are resolved and retested.

**Note:** HR/Payroll and other sensitive modules require extra scrutiny. If any module has not been personally tested, mark it as pending and do not include it in client delivery until verified.

This protocol is non-negotiable for ERP delivery. Attach this summary to all client handover documentation.
